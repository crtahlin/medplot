<h4>What is medplot?</h4>


<p> meplot is a web application developed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of longitudinal data. </p>

<p>The application was developed for biomedical researchers that wish to summarize, visualize and analyze longitudinal data where numerous variables are evaluated at multiple occasions for a group of subjects.</p> 

For example:

<ul>
  <li>it plots and summarizes longitudinal data</li>
  <li>it can analyze numerical and categorical outcomes.</li>
  <li>it statistically compares groups of samples, adjusting the analysis for multiple comparisons</li>
  <li>it estimates regression models for specific measurement occasions</li> 
  <li>it estimates mixed-effects regression models, taking the repeated measurements for each subject into account.</li>
</ul>



<h4>How to get started with medplot</h4>

<p> First time users can easily explore the features of medplot using the longitudinal data set of erythema migrans patients  included in the application (select Demo data in the sidebar panel). Data are described in detail  
 <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2010.0018">here</a> and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/crtahlin/medplot/blob/master/inst/extdata/DataEM.txt">here</a>.  </p>

<h4>How to prepare your own data</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Use the Excel template file. <a href="https://github.com/crtahlin/medplot/blob/master/inst/extdata/PlotSymptoms_shiny.xlsx?raw=true">Download it</a> and edit it.</li>
  <li>Use the Tab Separated Values (TSV) template. <a href="https://github.com/crtahlin/medplot/blob/master/inst/extdata/PlotSymptoms_TemplateTSV.txt">Download it</a> and edit it </li>
  <li>Save your own existing data in the Tab Separated Values (TSV) format.</li>
</ul>
